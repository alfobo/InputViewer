This software was tested using a 8bitdo Pro2 controller and as such it allowed me to test it with different controller api's:

- X-Input mode: Works flawlessly on both Windows 10 and Linux (Fedora 38)
  
- D-Input mode: Works in Windows but the triggers acts as buttons. I think this is how windows work with d-input controllers. Similar occurance when I had the Logitech F310 a while back. Not an issue under Linux
  
- Android mode: Works as intended on both platforms
  
- Switch mode: Works similarly to D-input in Linux, analog triggers act as a digital button. On Windows on the other hand... *RAVE!RAVE!RAVE!*
